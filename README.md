# NYU-6463Processor

## FINISHED WORK
**ACHD Final Project- Part 1**
1. VHDL code of the complete processor and its individual components. (along with testbenches)
2. Screenshots of Functional Simulation of all the individual components of the processor. (Please use a test bench to simulate)
3. Screenshots of Functional Simulation of the complete integrated processor. Use the two sample
codes provided and show the results (relevant register contents, data memory and program
counter value).
4. RC5 code in assembly
